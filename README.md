# SnakeGame

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Java.

## Overview

The Snake Game is a popular arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food items. The objective is to guide the snake to eat food items while avoiding collisions with the walls of the game area or the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: The snake moves continuously in the game area in a specified direction.
- **Food Generation**: Food items are randomly generated within the game area for the snake to consume.
- **Scoring**: The player earns points for each food item consumed, with the score increasing as the snake grows longer.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the snake and the walls or its own body, resulting in game over.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself, displaying the final score to the player.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment)  Eclipse

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Build the project.

4. Run the `App.java` class to start the game.

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
- Guide the snake to consume food items (represented by a different symbol) while avoiding collisions.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- The final score is displayed upon game over.
